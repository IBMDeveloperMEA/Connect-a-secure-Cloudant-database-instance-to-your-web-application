## Step 6: Create service credentials config file 



6.1 - Open your sample app in your editor (mine is Atom), create a new file, paste in the below code and save it as :"**vcap-local.json**" in config directory.


    {

      "services": {

      "cloudantNoSQLDB": {

      "credentials":

      PASTE CREDENTIAL INFO HERE

      ,

      "label": "cloudantNoSQLDB"

      }

        }

        }
